# Authentication Setup

## Changes Made

The authentication flow has been updated to properly require login before accessing the dashboard. Here are the key changes:

### 1. AuthContext.tsx
- **Removed automatic login**: Previously, the app automatically logged in a default user after 1 second
- **Added localStorage persistence**: User sessions are now saved to localStorage and restored on page reload
- **Added proper session management**: Users must explicitly log in through the login form

### 2. Index.tsx
- **Added authentication checks**: The app now properly checks if a user is logged in before showing the dashboard
- **Added console logging**: Debug logs help track the authentication flow

## How to Test

### First Time Access
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
2. You should see the login page (not the dashboard)
3. Use any email/password combination (demo mode)
4. After successful login, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

### Testing Logout
1. Click the "Sign Out" button in the sidebar
2. You should be redirected back to the login page
3. The localStorage will be cleared

### Testing Session Persistence
1. Log in to the application
2. Refresh the page or close and reopen the browser
3. You should remain logged in (session persists in localStorage)

### Clearing Session
1. Open the browser console
2. Run: `localStorage.removeItem('user')`
3. Refresh the page
4. You should see the login page again

## Demo Credentials
- **Email**: Any email address (e.g., `admin@company.com`)
- **Password**: Any password (e.g., `admin@company.com`)

## Console Logs
The application now includes console logging to help debug authentication:
- `AuthContext: Initializing authentication...`
- `AuthContext: Found saved user:` or `AuthContext: No saved user found`
- `Index: Current auth state - user: ... loading: ...`
- `Index: No user found, showing login page` or `Index: User authenticated, showing dashboard`

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Core authentication logic
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Authentication flow control
- `test-auth.html` - Helper file for testing localStorage
